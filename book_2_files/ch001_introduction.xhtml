   In the world of online audio and video there is a group of technologies and techniques refered to as
   <strong>
    streaming
   </strong>
   . Streaming, at its simplest, is the delivery of audio and video over the internet in
   <strong>
    realtime
   </strong>
   . Traditionally streaming has been used for delivering live internet 
radio, or for broadcasting events over the internet so you can watch 
them at home.
  </p>
  <p>
   Streaming is often talked about using terms from the broadcasting 
industry as live internet audio and video are often seen as being 
analogous to broadcast television and radio. Hence you might talk about 
'internet radio' to refer to live online audio. Sometimes people refer 
to sending live audio or video using streaming as 'broadcasting on the 
net' or as a 'internet broadcast'. These terms are helpful for helping 
us understand the intended purpose of streaming but don't take them too 
literally. However it is useful to refer to these models when explaining
 the role of Icecast.

   With broadcast television or radio there is transmitter that 
distributes the signal sent from the studio, to your television or 
radio.

   With internet broadcasting (streaming) you replace the transmitter with a
   <strong>
    streaming server
   </strong>
   , which is really a kind of software.

   <strong>
    Icecast
   </strong>
   is this kind of software. It enables you to distribute live audio and video across the internet in realtime.

   </span>
   Note that this is only part of the equation. You also need a
   <strong>
    stream encoder
   </strong>
   that can send the original audio or video stream to Icecast. Icecast 
distributes the stream, it does not create the stream - that's the job 
of the encoder.

   Icecast is a very mature technology and very robust. It supports the 
delivery of many different formats of streaming audio (including MP3 and
 Ogg Vorbis) and it supports the delivery of Ogg Theora for streaming 
video. Icecast runs on
   <strong>
    Linux
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    Windows
   </strong>
   . If you wish to install it on Linux you will need to have some 
experience with Linux; specifically you will need to know a bit about 
how to install software from the command line, and be comfortable 
editing text based configuration files. The Windows installation process
 is a little bit more straight forward but you still need to be 
comfortable editing text based configuration files.
  </p>
  <p>
   Installing and running Icecast is not recommended for inexperienced users.
